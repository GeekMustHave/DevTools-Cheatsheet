In order to address some browser issues reports by users of web applications it becomes
necessary to use the `Dev Tools` build into the browser.

Dev Tools can be executed by pressing the kbd:[F12] key.
The GUI for Dev tools varies from one browser to another.

Often the Dev Tools can uncover some issues on how the browser and the web application interact.
The Web Tools provide a way to vide the JavaScript and CSS errors that can't be seen normally.

NOTE: The DevTools kbd:[F12] will appear slightly different depending on the browser you are using.

== Console

One of the most powerful features for debugging a web app is the `Console`.  In some cases there are errors and warning that can't bee seen without the Dev-Tools console.

=== Chrome Browser

=== Internet Explorer (not Edge)

=== Writing to the console

Use the `console.log()` method for any basic logging to the console. It takes one or more expressions as parameters and writes their current values to the console, concatenating multiple parameters into a space-delimited line. 


== Browser Versions

The browsr version can often have an impact on how a web page performs and displays.



=== Chrome Version
Display the current version information about Chrome.

NOTE: This is entered in as a URL, *not* a kbd:[F12] DevTool command.

[source,Powershell]
----
chrome://device

=== Internet Explorer Version

Some issues are caused by the wrong version of Internet Explorer being used.  

This is done from the DevTools kbd:[F12] menu.

.Ineternet Explorer Version

You can change the Version of the IE browser by selecting one from the list.  The Internet Explorer Version will temporarily be set to that version.

This great for testing if the IE browser version is the issue.
 
 


=== Edge Version (Emulation)

The newer Microsoft Edge browser has an `Emulation` feature from the menu that lets you emulate many different browsers.

This is done from the DevTools kbd:[F12] menu.

== Command Menu

Many of the commands for the Dev tools can be quickly access via the Google Chrome Command Menu.

A description of the Chrome Devtools protocol with commands is available https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/[at this link,window='_blank']. 

=== Google Chrome Browser

Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] for the Command Menu, then scroll up and down list for the command you need.

This example also shows how the `group` can be used to make the format look professional.

[source,JavaScript]
----
console.group("Testing Timestamp");
console.log("Phoenix Workgroup Test");
now = new Date();
console.log( now );
console.groupEnd();
