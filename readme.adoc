In order to address some browser issues reports by users of web applications it becomes
necessary to use the `Dev Tools` build into the browser.

Dev Tools can be executed by pressing the KBD:[F12] key.
The GUI for Dev tools varies from one browser to another.

Often the Dev Tools can uncover some issues on how the browser and the web application interact.
The Web Tools provide a way to vide the JavaScript and CSS errors that can't be seen normally.

== Console

One of the most powerful features for debugging a web app is the `Console`.  In some cases there are errors and warning that can't bee seen without the Dev-Tools console.

=== Writing to the console

Use the `console.log()` method for any basic logging to the console. It takes one or more expressions as parameters and writes their current values to the console, concatenating multiple parameters into a space-delimited line. 

== Command Menu

Many of the commands for the Dev tools can be quickly access via the Command Menu.

Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] for the Command Menu, then scroll up and down list for the command you need.
